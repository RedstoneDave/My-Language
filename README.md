# Jaketo - A Constructed Language for an Isekai

Jaketo (IPA: \[jaˈkʰe.tʰo\]) is a constructed “natural” language rather than a programming language. The language part of this repository and all texts written in Jaketo are published under [CC BY-SA 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode), all code in [the code folder](/code/) is published under the MIT License, all fonts in [the fonts folder](/fonts/) are published under the SIL License.

## Idea

Jaketo is a language used by people in an isekai where exists “krin”, a power people in our world may consider as magic. Some people are born with the ability to master krin (called “krinu”), the others are born without the power (called “krina”).

Jaketo reflects the views of the people in the world, and ultimately reflects some thoughts of the author itself (yes, the author uses “it” as its pronoun, but if you are uncomfortable with that, I'm OK with either “he” or “she”).

There are no words that correspond to “good” or “bad”, “right” or “wrong”, “must” or “forbid”, instead, more specific feeling describing, logic or value describing and conditional expressions are used.

## Examples

## Phonology

Each syllable of Jaketo is divided into four parts, the base, the glide, the vowel, the terminal.

### Base

The base is basically the starting consonant of a syllable, all possible bases are shown below.

|           | Bilabial | Alveolar | Velar | Glottal |
| --------- | -------- | -------- | ----- | ------- |
| Plosive   | pʰ b     | tʰ d     | kʰ ɡ  | ʔ       |
| Nasal     | m        | n        |       | N/A     |
| Fricative |          | s        |       |         |
| Affricate |          | ts (z)   |       |         |

the void base is the glottal stop or just nothing, is nothing or a ⟨'⟩ in the Romanisation. The Romanisation of the base \[ts\] is ⟨z⟩.

### Glide

A glide is basically a consonant after the base, apart from the void glide (which means no glide), there are four glides, which are (in the Romanisation):

- ⟨l⟩
  - a special glide that actually alters the consonant of the base, details are below.
  - when appearing with the void base, reads \[ɰ\], but the sequence ⟨'lu⟩ reads \[y\],
  - if you are familiar with ancient Chinese, then this is just similar to the “èrděng”(二等) approximant.
- ⟨r⟩
  - the tap/flap \[ɾ\]
- ⟨j⟩
  - the approximant \[j\]
  - ⟨tj⟩ = ⟨zj⟩ = \[tɕ\]; ⟨sj⟩ = \[ɕ\]; ⟨dj⟩ = \[dʑ\]; ⟨kj⟩ = \[c\]; ⟨gj⟩ = \[ɟ\]
  - ⟨pj⟩ = ⟨bj⟩ = \[psV\], specially, ⟨pi⟩ and ⟨bi⟩ reads \[psɯː\], and nasal terminals after these forms become the ⟨l⟩ terminal.
- ⟨w⟩
  - the approximant \[w\], sometimes realised as \[v\] or \[ʋ\]

|               | Labialdental              | Alveolar                | Glottal             |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| Fricative     | f (pl = ⟨f⟩) v (bl = ⟨v⟩) |                         | h (kl = ⟨h⟩) ɦ (gl) |
| Lateral Fric. | N/A                       | ɬ (sl = ⟨c⟩) ɮ (zl; dl) |                     |
| Lateral Affr. | N/A                       | tɬ (tl)                 |                     |

the ⟨f⟩ ⟨v⟩ ⟨c⟩ ⟨h⟩ above are alias for those base-l sequences. The \[ɦ\] is omitted in some dialects. The combinations ⟨ml⟩ and ⟨nl⟩ does not exist (at least no more).

### Vowel

The table below shows the vowel phonemes of Jaketo. The schwa can be omitted as it doesn't feel hard to read through, however it's Romanisation ⟨y⟩ cannot be omitted.

|        | Front | Mid   | Back  |
| ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Top    | i (i) |       | ɯ (u) |
| Middle | e̞ (e) | ə (y) | o̞ (o) |
| Bottom |       | ä (a) |       |

In the parenthesis are the Romanisation of the vowels. Besides the vowels above, there is a special symbol with a Romanisation of ⟨q⟩ that is put to the end of a verb or stative verb to mark that the last base is muted, which is to tell the reader which word it is and how it's transformed.

### Terminal

The terminal is basically the ending consonant of a syllable, apart from the void terminal, there are eight terminals, which are:

- n
  - the nasal \[n\], realised as \[ɴ\] at the end of a word, as \[ŋ\] before a velar consonant, does not appear before a bilabial consonant.
- m
- j
- w
  - often realised as \[f\] or \[v\]
- s
- z
  - as is in the base, reads \[ts\]
- x
  - a glottal stop at the end of a word, or lengthens the next base
  - for example: ⟨mexka⟩ reads \[mek̚.ka\]
- l
  - lengthens the vowel

### Special Cases

- \[ta\] not being the first syllable of a word read \[ɾa\]

## Grammar in a nutshell

Jaketo is an agglutinative language highly relying on case particals and auxiliary words.

Jaketo nouns have twelve cases for adverbial use, which are:

- topic (TOP)
  - marks the topic of the sentence.
- direct (DIR)
  - marks the direct case (as in the [symmetric voice system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetrical_voice)), the TOP will be the DIR if no DIR is present.
- ergative-ablative (ERG)
- accusative (ACC)
- allative (ALL)
- dative (DAT)
- instrumental (INS)
- locative (LOC)
- comitative (COM)
- anti-comitative (ANT)
- terminative (TERM)
- identical (ID)
  - the same as “as” as in “as me”, maybe linguistics will call it the formal case, but it makes no difference to me.

and the genitive (GEN) case for attibute use.

Jaketo has no grammatical gender or number, hence no gender and number agreement. However, Jaketo uses the symmetrical voice and has five triggers, which are for ACC, ALL, INS, DAT, ERG.

Jaketo's clause system is similar to that of Old Japanese.

## Orthography

Jaketo uses the writing system Jakecu, which is an abugida system, details are to be written in a pdf file
