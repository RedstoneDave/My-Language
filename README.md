# Kratoma - A Constructed Language for an Isekai

Kratoma is a constructed “natural” language rather than a programming language.

## Phonology

### Consonants

The table below shows the consonant phonemes of Kratoma.

|             | Bilabial | Labialdental | Alveolar | PastAlveolar | Palatal | Velar | Glottal |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------ | -------- | ------------ | ------- | ----- | ------- |
| Plosive     | pʰ b     |              | tʰ d     |              |         | kʰ ɡ  |         |
| Nasal       | m        |              | n        |              |         |       | N/A     |
| Fricative   |          | f v          | s z      | ʃ(c) ʒ(l)    |         |       | h       |
| Tap or flap |          |              | ɾ        |              |         | N/A   | N/A     |
| Approximant | w        |              |          |              | j(y)    |       | N/A     |

and the list here shows some variations:

- /p\b/ = \[ɸ\] (`\b` here means the end of a word, the same below)
- /m(a)/ = \[β(a)\]
- /n(kɡ)/ = \[ŋ(kɡ)\]
- /n\b/ = \[ɴ\]
- /sʲ/ = \[ɕ\]
- /zʲ/ = \[ʑ\] or \[d͡ʑ\]
- /(ptk)ɾ(a)/ = \[(ptk)χ(ɑ)\]
- /ɾ\b/ = \[l\]

### Vowels

The table below shows the vowel phonemes of Kratoma. The schwa here is pronounced only when it's hard to pronounce two consonants successively.

|        | Front | Mid | Back |
| ------ | ----- | --- | ---- |
| Top    | i     |     | ɯ    |
| Middle | e̞     | (ə) | o̞    |
| Bottom |       | ä   |      |

and the list here shows some variations:

## Grammar

Kratoma is an agglutinative language highly relying on case particals and auxiliary words.

### Nouns

In Kratoma, nouns are called `sokan`, `sokan` is the only type of word that can have case particals after one. An example of `sokan` is `fesa` (meaning “human”), here are the forms of the word `fesa`:

- `fesazu`
  - `zu` indecates the topic, a similar example is the partical “は” in Japanese.
  - e.g. `fozu raez`, meaning “I'm tall”, where `fo` is the pronoun “me” and `raez` is the adjective “tall”.
- `fesasu`
  - `su` indecates the subject (or nominative), a similar example is the partical “が” in Japanese.
  - In dependent clauses, `su` is more frequently used than `zu`
  - e.g. `fesazu kasasu udaz` meaning “Human have long legs” (lit. humans (are of which) legs (are) long).
- `fesasem`
  - `sem` indecates the tool (aka. instrumental), and the manner of an action
