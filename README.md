## Phonology

### Consonants

## Grammar

Kratoma is an agglutinative language highly relying on case particals and auxiliary words.

### Nouns

In Kratoma, nouns are called `sokan`, `sokan` is the only type of word that can have case particals after one. An example of `sokan` is `fesa` (meaning “human”), here are the forms of the word `fesa`:

- `fesazu`
  - `zu` indecates the topic, a similar example is the partical “は” in Japanese.
  - e.g. `fozu raez`, means “I'm tall”, where `fo` is the pronoun “me” and `raez` is the adjective “tall”.
- `fesasu`
  - `su` indecates the subject (or nominative), a similar example is the partical “が” in Japanese.
  - In dependent clauses, `su` is more frequently used than `zu`
  - e.g. `fesazu kasasu udaz` means “Human have long legs” (lit. humans (are of which) legs (are) long).
- `fesasem`
  - `sem` indecates the tool (aka. instrumental), and the manner of an action
- `fesako`
  - `ko` indecates the direction (aka. allative)
  - This is also the case meaning “become”
  - e.g. `fozu zekeko kasep` means “I walk to there” and `fozu fesako der` means “I become a human”
- `fesabu`
  - `bu` indecates the direct object (or accusative)
  - e.g. `fozu kilabu zazit` means “I eat fish”
- `fesado`
  - `do` indecates the dative, as “me” in “you give me the book”, and purpose is also indecated by `do`, though the latter usually appears earlier
  - e.g. `fozu zedo lavbu usat` means “I give them a book” where `ze` is a singular, sexually neutral pronoun, and `lav` means “book”, while `fozu kado ocom` means “I sing for you” where `ka` means “you”.
- `fesacu`
  - `cu` indecates the position, also time.
  - e.g. `fozu fokecu muk` means “I am here” (lit. I exist at here)
- `fesaye`
  - `ye` indecates the ablative, meaning “from”, and the ergative in passive forms (as “by ...” in English)
  - e.g. `fozu zekeye vep` means “I come from there” where `zeke` means “there” and `vep` means “to come”, and `fozu beuye nociken` means “I'm abandoned by the society” where `beu` means “the world” and “the society” and `noc` means “to abandon; to desert”, `-iken` makes a verb passive
- `fesawe`
  - `we` indecates the terminative, meaning “until”
  - e.g. `zezu rusyawe furvusk` means “He has been young until today” where `rusya` means “today” and `furva` means “young” and `-usk` means “have been”
