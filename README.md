# Jaketo - A Constructed Language for an Isekai

Jaketo (IPA: \[jaˈkʰe.tʰo\]) is a constructed “natural” language rather than a programming language. The language part of this repository is published under [CC BY-SA 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode), and if one day the author writes some code about the project, that code will be published under the MIT License.

## Idea

Jaketo is a language used by people in an isekai where exists “krin”, a power people in our world may consider as magic. Some people are born with the ability to master krin (called “krinu”), the others are born without the power (called “krina”).

Jaketo reflects the views of the people in the world, and ultimately reflects some thoughts of the author itself (yes, the author uses “it” as its pronoun, but if you are uncomfortable with that, I'm OK with either “he” or “she”).

There are no words that correspond to “good” or “bad”, “right” or “wrong”, “must” or “forbid”, instead, more specific feeling describing, logic or value describing and conditional expressions are used.

## Phonology

Each syllable of Jaketo is divided into four parts, the base, the glide, the vowel, the terminal.

### Base

The base is basically the starting consonant of a syllable, all possible bases are shown below.

|           | Bilabial | Alveolar | Velar | Glottal |
| --------- | -------- | -------- | ----- | ------- |
| Plosive   | pʰ b     | tʰ d     | kʰ ɡ  | ʔ       |
| Nasal     | m        | n        |       | N/A     |
| Fricative |          | s        |       |         |
| Affricate |          | ts (z)   |       |         |

the void base is the glottal stop or just nothing, is nothing or a ⟨'⟩ in the Romanisation. The Romanisation of the base \[ts\] is ⟨z⟩.

### Glide

A glide is basically a consonant after the base, apart from the void glide (which means no glide), there are four glides, which are (in the Romanisation):

- ⟨l⟩
  - a special glide that actually alters the consonant of the base, details are below.
  - when appearing with the void base, reads \[ɰ\], but the sequence ⟨'lu⟩ reads \[y\],
  - if you are familiar with ancient Chinese, then this is just similar to the “èrděng”(二等) approximant.
- ⟨r⟩
  - the tap/flap \[ɾ\]
- ⟨j⟩
  - the approximant \[j\]
  - ⟨tj⟩ = ⟨zj⟩ = \[tɕ\]; ⟨sj⟩ = \[ɕ\]; ⟨dj⟩ = \[dʑ\]; ⟨kj⟩ = \[c\]; ⟨gj⟩ = \[ɟ\]
- ⟨w⟩
  - the approximant \[w\], sometimes realised as \[v\] or \[ʋ\]

|               | Labialdental              | Alveolar                | Glottal             |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| Fricative     | f (pl = ⟨f⟩) v (bl = ⟨v⟩) |                         | h (kl = ⟨h⟩) ɦ (gl) |
| Lateral Fric. | N/A                       | ɬ (sl = ⟨c⟩) ɮ (zl; dl) |                     |
| Lateral Affr. | N/A                       | tɬ (tl)                 |                     |

the ⟨f⟩ ⟨v⟩ ⟨c⟩ ⟨h⟩ above are alias for those base-l sequences. The \[ɦ\] is omitted in some dialects. The combinations ⟨ml⟩ and ⟨nl⟩ does not exist (at least no more).

### Vowel

The table below shows the vowel phonemes of Jaketo. The schwa can be omitted as it doesn't feel hard to read through, however it's Romanisation ⟨y⟩ cannot be omitted.

|        | Front | Mid   | Back  |
| ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Top    | i (i) |       | ɯ (u) |
| Middle | e̞ (e) | ə (y) | o̞ (o) |
| Bottom |       | ä (a) |       |

In the parenthesis are the Romanisation of the vowels. Besides the vowels above, there is a special symbol with a Romanisation of ⟨q⟩ that is put to the end of a verb or stative verb to mark that the last base is muted, which is to tell the reader which word it is and how it's transformed.

### Terminal

The terminal is basically the ending consonant of a syllable, apart from the void terminal, there are eight terminals, which are:

- n
  - the nasal \[n\], realised as \[ɴ\] at the end of a word, as \[ŋ\] before a velar consonant, does not appear before a bilabial consonant.
- m
- j
- w
  - often realised as \[f\] or \[v\]
- s
- z
  - as is in the base, reads \[ts\]
- x
  - a glottal stop at the end of a word, or lengthens the next base
  - for example: ⟨mexka⟩ reads \[mek̚.ka\]
- l
  - lengthens the vowel

## Parts of Speech

(Awaiting changes)

Jaketo is an agglutinative language highly relying on case particals and auxiliary words. Basic grammar forms can be found in the file `grammar.ebnf`.

Jaketo has five parts of speech, `sokan` (nouns), `burab` (verbs), `mosrab` (stative verbs), `garasu` (adjectives), `unekin` (numerals).

### Nouns

In Jaketo, nouns are called `sokan`, `sokan` is the only type of word that can have case particals after one. An example of `sokan` is `fesa` (meaning “human”). Specially, some pronouns have contracted forms when sticked to a case partical, forms can be viewed in the `pronoun.yml` file.

Here are the forms of the word `fesa`:

- `fesazu`
  - `zu` indecates the topic, a similar example is the partical “は” in Japanese.
  - e.g. `prazu raez`, means “I’m tall”, where `pra` is the pronoun “me” and `raez` is the adjective “tall”.
- `fesasu`
  - `su` indecates the subject (or the “direct case”), a similar example is the partical “が” in Japanese.
  - In dependent clauses, `su` is more frequently used than `zu`
  - e.g. `fesazu kasasu udaz` means “Human have long legs” (lit. humans (are of which) legs (are) long), where `kasa` means “leg” and `udaz` is the adjective “long”.
- `fesasem`
  - `sem` indecates the instrumental (ie. the tool), and the manner of an action
- `fesako`
  - `ko` indecates the allative (ie. the direction)
  - This is also the case meaning “become”
  - e.g. `prazu zekeko kasep` means “I walk to there” and `prazu fesako der` means “I become a human”
- `fesabu`
  - `bu` indecates the patient (or accusative, or direct object)
  - e.g. `prazu kilabu zazit` means “I eat fish”
- `fesado`
  - `do` indecates the dative, as “me” in “you give me the book”, and purpose is also indecated by `do`, though the latter usually appears earlier
  - e.g. `prazu zed (= zedo) lavbu usat` means “I give them a book” where `ze` is a singular, sexually neutral pronoun, and `lav` means “book”
  - and `prazu kado ocom` means “I sing for you” where `ka` means “you”.
- `fesacu`
  - `cu` indecates the position, also time.
  - e.g. `prazu prakecu mjuk` means “I am here” (lit. I exist at here)
- `fesakaf`
  - `kaf` indecates the comitative, as “with me” in “He went on a walk with me”, used in neutral cases or cases where the candidates are of the same attention.
  - e.g. `prakaf kasep` means “to walk with me”
- `fesanof`
  - `nof` indecates the “anti-comitative”, as “against me” in “He fought against me”, used in cases there the candidates are of the opposite attention.
  - e.g. `avrova beunof wakit` means “to fight against the old world”
- `fesaye`
  - `ye` indecates the ablative, meaning “from”, and the agentive in non-agentive trigger forms (as “by ...” in English)
  - e.g. `prazu zekeye vep` means “I come from there” where `zeke` means “there” and `vep` means “to come”
  - and `prazu beuye nocins` means “I’m abandoned by the society” where `beu` means “the world” and “the society” and `noc` means “to abandon; to desert”, `-ins` makes a verb passive
- `fesawe`
  - `we` indecates the terminative, meaning “until”
  - e.g. `zez (= zezu) rusyawe furvusk` means “He has been young until today” where `rusya` means “today” and `furva` means “young” and `-usk` means “have been”

Forms above are the “adverbial” forms that directly modifies the predicate (ie. the center of a sentence), while the ones below go to other positions.

- `fesama`
  - `ma` indecates the genetive case (ie. belonging)
  - e.g. `fesama kasazu udaz` means “Human’s legs are long”, in which “leg” is the subject and the topic.
- `fesanuva`
  - `-nuva` after a noun transforms it into an adjective, meaning “like ...” or say “-(l)y” as in “friendly”
  - Examples will be given in the section about adjectives.
- `fesaluva`
  - `-luva` after a noun also transforms it into an adjective, meaning “about”
  - Examples will be given in the section about adjectives.

And `sokan`s can take the part of predicate, such as `prazu fesa`, meaning “I’m human”.

### Verbs

There are two parts of speech correspond to verbs in English, `burab` and `mosrab`, this section is about `burab`, verbs that can tell apart “before” and “after”. An example of `burab` is `vebq`(meaning “to do”). Here are the forms of the word `vebq`.

- `vebu`
  - `u` after a `burab` enables it to join with other words, to modify the predicate, and to form a dependent clause.
  - Most conjugations are formed by the form `vebu-` with an auxiliary word (in the file `auxiliary words.yaml`).
- `vebem`
  - `-em` basically means “to un(do)” and `vebem` is also a `burab`.
- `veben`
  - `-en` means “not to do” and `veben` is a `mosrab`.
  - e.g. `prazu mupen` means “I don’t sleep” where `mup` means “to sleep”.
- `vebeh`
  - `-eh` means “before doing” and `vebeh` is a `mosrab`
  - e.g.
- `vebins`
  - `-ins` means “to be done” and `vebins` is a `burab`
  - Just in case you forgot this, “by ...” is represented using `ye`
  - e.g. `prazu beuye nocins` means “I’m abandoned by the society”
  - Technically, `-ins` indecates [the patient trigger voice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetrical_voice), as the agent of the verb isn't represented in the form of “prep. ACC”.
- `vebisp`
  - `-isp` means “to be used to do” and `vebisp` is a `burab`
  - e.g. `ovizu praye cazobu kawakisp` means “the knife is used to cut the fruit by me”, where `ovi` means “knife”, `cazo` “fruit” and `kawak` “to cut”.
  - Like the `-ins` above, the `-isp` indecates the tool trigger voice.
- `vebist`
  - the dative trigger voice.
  - e.g. `zez praye lavbu usatist` means “He is given a book by me”.
- \*`deriks`
  - `-iks` means “to let do” and `deriks` is a `burab`
  - used where the verb has a default trigger other than the agentive, and makes it an agentive trigger voice, therefore `vebiks` is invalid.
- `vebod`
  - `-od` means “in order to do” and `vebod` is a `mosrab`
- `veba`
  - `-a` transforms a `burab` to a noun, as “-ing” or “to -” or “-ion” or “-ment”
- `vebin` / `vebwa`
  - these two transform a `burab` to a noun, as “-er” in English
  - `-in` indecates a human executor, and `-wa` indecates non-human executor.
- `vebas`
  - `-as` is similar to “-ee” in English
  - It gives the patient
- `vebo`
  - `-o` enables a `burab` to modify a noun
  - e.g. `kasepo fesa` means “running person” where `kasep` means “to run”.
- `vebai`
  - `-ai` means will or wish.
  - e.g. `kasai` means “Arise!”, and `retarai` means “Please rain!”
- `veban`
  - `-an` means negative will or wish.
  - e.g. `retaran` means “Please don’t rain!”

### Stative Verbs

This section is about `mosrab`, the stative verbs that cannot tell apart “before” or “after”. An example of `mosrab` is `mjukq` (meaning “to be; to exist”). Here are the forms of the word `mjukq`.

- `mjuke`
  - `e` after a `mosrab` enables it to join with other words, to modify the predicate and to form a dependent clause, just like `u` after a `burab`
- `onq`
  - `onq` means “not to be”, and with words other than `mjukq`, its straightly used after the word, yet `onq` is used instead of `mjukonq`. `onq` is a `mosrab`.
  - e.g. `prazu kavonq` means “I’m not standing” where `kavq` means “to be standing”
- `mjukas`
  - this is the same as the `as` above, representing the patient.
- `mjukju`
  - `-ju` transforms a `mosrab` to a noun, the same as `veba` above.
- `mjukumva`
  - `-umva` transforms a `mosrab` to an adjective, this allows it to use comparison.
- `mjuki`
  - `-i` enables a `mosrab` to modify a noun, just like `o` after a `burab`.
  - e.g. `mjuki fesa` means “existing person”
- `mjuku-` + ( `ns` | `sp` | `st` | `ks` )
  - the same as the forms of `burab` above.

### Adjectives

Adjectives in Jaketo are called `gasaru`, the semantic division between `gasaru` and `mosrab` is not clear, and these two can transform to each other. An example of `gasaru` is `krava` (meaning “blue; azure; cute”).

Adjectives have two basic forms, one is the modifier form, the other is the predicative form. In dictionaries, adjectives are shown in the first form, which ends in `-va`, the second form is obtained by replacing the `-va` with `-z`. For example, the modifier form `krava` has a corresponding predicative form `kraz`. Other variants are shown below.

- `kravu`
  - this form is the same as the `mjuke` and `vebu` form.
  - e.g. `luvu kasepq` means “to walk fast” where `luva` means “fast” and `kasep` means “to walk”
- `kranava`
  - `-nava` is the negative suffix, and `kranava` means “not blue”
  - e.g. `prazu furnaz` means “I’m not young”
- `kraheva`
  - `-kseva` is the comparative suffix, and `kraheva` means “more blue”
  - e.g. `krinzu kreye krahez` means “Krin is more blue than water”, a proverb which means “the younger generation have more energy and opportunities”
- `krarava`
  - `-rava` is the superlative suffix, and `krarava` means “most blue”
  - e.g. `prazu luravu kasepq` means “I walk the fastest”.
- `kravan`
  - `-van` makes the adjective an abstract noun, yet `kra` it self is the noun “blue” so `kravan` is basically never used.
- `kravel`
  - `-vel` makes the adjective an instance noun, and `kravel` means “something blue”
  - e.g. `prazu kravelbu tesinq` means “I like blue things” or “I like cute things”

### Numerals

Numerals in Jaketo are called `unekin`, this word is formed from the words for 1, 2 and 3. However, `unekin` has more words than numbers, concepts like “many” `mo`, “part” `ecu`, “same” `wa`, “common” `hwa` are also `unekin`s. Let’s take the word `u` (meaning “one”) for example. Here are the forms of the word.

- `un`
  - `-n` enables an `unekin` to modify a noun.
  - e.g. `un fesa` means “a person”
- `uk`
  - `-k` transforms an `unekin` into a noun
  - e.g. `pranzu wok` means “this is all”, where `pran` means “this” and `wo` means “all”.
- `uceva`
  - `-ceva` transforms an `unekin` into an adjective
  - e.g. `mocekseva` means “more”

More information about Numerals is shown in `grammar.md` section `Numeral Combination Rule`.

### Adverbials

Technically, there is no unique word class “adverb” in Jaketo, the role of adverbs is mostly played by adverbial form of adjectives and partially the stative verbs (such as “always” can be represented using the auxiliary stative verb `vekc`). Yet, some particals can be attached to adverbial forms to adjust their meaning. The topic partical `zu` is usually omitted when having these suffixes. Let’s take the adverbial form `kravu` of the adjective `krava` as an example:

- `kravul`
  - `-l` means “also; even”, similar to “も” in Japanese. The latter meaning is more often used in (semantically) affirmative expressions.
  - e.g. `prazu lavbu tesin. zel lavbu tesin` means “I like books, and he also likes books”.
- `kravusy`
  - `-sy` means “even; as long as”, similar to “さえ” in Japanese. The first meaning is more often used in (semantically) negative expressions.
  - When used in conditional clauses, `-sy` takes the latter meaning “as long as”.
  - e.g. `prasy zenbu maiveren` means “Even I don’t understand that”, where `maiver` means “to understand”; `prazu zenbusy maiveren` means “I don’t even understand that”. The former implies that “I’m understand a lot of things, but even it’s me, that is too hard to understand”, the latter implies that “That is easy, but I’m too stupid to understand such easy thing”.
- `kravud`
  - `-d` means “while”, similar to “…うちに” in Japanese. This implies suitable and optimal circumstances for some action.
  - e.g. `mipened, epai` means “Set out before it has vanished” (lit. While it doesn’t vanish, go!)
- `kravuv`
  - `-v` means “only”, similar to “だけ” in Japanese.
  - e.g. `prav pranbu vebutez` means “Only I can do this”; `prazu pranbuv vebutez` means “I can only do this”, the difference is as it’s shown in the example in the `-sy` particle.
- `kravuck`
  - `-ck` means “(as ...) as ...”, similar to “のように” in Japanese.
  - e.g. `prazu zesu tezeck vebutez` means “I can do this as he can”; `prazu zesu raevuck raez` means “I’m as tall as he is”.

## Clauses

Jaketo is predicate-based, every other component in a sentence is analysed to be an adverbial (ie. modifier) of the predicate. The predicate of a clause could be a `sokan`, `burab`, `mosrab` or `-z` form of `gasaru`, as for `unekin`, just add a `-k` to it to form a `sokan`.

### Independent Clause

A complete sencense has one independent clause, the predicate of which is of the predicate form, and any other component takes some adverbial form to modify the predicate (or some adjective form to modify some noun, but usually, noun phrases are analysed as a whole component).

The order of the components are rather free, and could change as the emphasized component varies, yet the most common order is “SOV”.

### Dependent Clause

Different from independent clauses, dependent clauses could only have their predicate at the end to avoid potential ambiguity.

#### Adjective Clause

Adjective clauses modify nouns, they come directly before the modified nouns with the predicate part adjacent to it. In case you forgot this, the adjective forms of the parts of speech above are:

- `(sokan)-ma`
- `(burab)-o`
- `(mosrab)-i`
- `(gasaru)(va form)`
- `(unekin)-n`

#### Simple Adverbial Clause

#### Compound Clause

#### Complex Adverbial Clause
