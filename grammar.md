# Special Kratoma Grammar

This document is for the pieces of grammar that are hard to be put into `grammar.ebnf`.

## Reflexive Prefix

A reflexive prefix could be added to a verb or stative verb to indecate the accusative or dative of the verb to be a reflexive pronoun. The rule of the prefix is shown below:

- accusative:
  - if the word begins with a consonant, then an `a` is added to the beginning;
  - if the word begins with a vowel, then an `ak` is added to the beginning;
- dative:
  - if the word begins with a consonant, then an `aw` is added to the beginning;
  - if the word begins with a vowel, then an `ab` is added to the beginning.

## “Plug-in” Clause

This consept is similar to the “noun clause” in English, however, “plug-in” clauses can take place of any part of speech. This allows speakers to refer to some uncertain actions or properties without the form of auxiliary verbs with nouns.

The “plug-in” words are `bru` for `sokan` and `unekin`, `brub` for `burab`, `bruk` for `mosrab` and `bruva` for `gasaru`. A clause with a “plug-in” word can change the predicate into the “complex type” (the one used in the conditional clause) and add an `-m` to it to modify the same “plug-in” word.
